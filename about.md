## Hi. I’m Avinash

<p class="message">
  I have done my graduation and post graduation both in Computer Science Engineering and currently working as a Data Scientist in Catalina Marketing Japan.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  I’m passionate about applying my knowledge of computer science and machine learning to areas in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Time Series data, Recommendation Engines and other innovative areas in AI.
  I believe, machine learning and computer science really have the power to make the computers understand the real life problems using data and produce great solutions for humanity which has never been seen.
  I am a vivid learner, keep learning and writing new things everyday.
